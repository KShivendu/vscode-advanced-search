# VS code advanced search and replace

This extension allows you to do a structured search on the code and replace it. This is much more powerful than the built-in search and replace which is limited to regex at the best.

## Setup:

1. Follow https://pnpm.io/installation to install pnpm.
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
3. Go to `packages/webview` and run `pnpm dev`. This will build the UI of the extension.
4. Install comby from https://comby.dev/docs/get-started
5. Open the "Run and debug" panel in VS code and click "Run Extension" to run the extension
